        <p><em>Original recipe from Katy Parla's,</em> <a href= "https://www.amazon.com/Food-Italian-South-Recipes-Disappearing/dp/1524760463/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2VT2LW787G7HX&keywords=food+of+the+italian+south&qid=1585188887&sprefix=food+of+the+ital%2Caps%2C150&sr=8-1"><em>Food of the Italian South.</em></a> </p>
    
    <h2><em>The Story</em></h2>
        <p>One of the easiest ways to make a fantastic dish is to use ingredients at their finest, and cook them in a way that maxes out their potential flavors. For this reason, cibo povera, or peasant food, maintains a place in my heart as one of my favorite categories of food. </p>
       
        <p>This pasta dish in particular utilizes four common ingredients: pasta, tomatoes, pesto, and burrata. While the latter is still growing in recognition in the States, the others are commonly found in households, or at least in most grocery stores. Every ingredient is prepped in a way to bring out as much natural flavor as possible, and every flavor is balanced, matched, and emphasized by another. </p>
        
        <P>I first made this recipe as a media project for my job at <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/">Caputo Brothers Creamery</a>. The intention was simply to make a video involving mozzarella to keep people interested in our brand at the height of the pandemic. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXXlQSv6mPI">video itself</a> ended up being a blatant rip-off of <em>Binging with Babish</em>, but the dish has become an easy favorite of mine. Iâ€™ve only been to Italy once, but this simple dish always manages to whisk me back to Calabria & Apulia. I hope you enjoy, cherish, and share this as much as I have.</P>

    <h2><em>The Recipe</em></h2>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>About a pint of heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 lbs <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/products/capomozz-mozzarella-curd">Capo Mozz</a></li>
            <li>2-4 cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 cup almonds</li>
            <li>1 cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>2+ Tbsp Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
            <li>1lbs fresh or dry orecchiette</li>
            <li>Extra Virgin Olive Oil <strong>(EVOO)</strong></li>
            <li>Sea or kosher salt for stretching and seasoning</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Burrata:</h3>
        <p>Pour heavy cream into a bowl. Stretch Capo Mozz per instructions into mozzarella balls or long strands. Tear mozzarella into smaller strings no thicker than a charging cable (unlike how I did in the gif below), and place into heavy cream to let soak. Season mixture with salt until the burrata has a "brine like" taste.</p>
    <h3>Tomatoes:</h3>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 250F. Combine tomatoes, 2 Tbsp EVOO, and oregano in a bowl. Season with salt, move to a baking tray, and roast until tomatoes are shriveled and dry, ~90 minutes.</p>
    <h3>Pesto:</h3>
        <p>Using a mortar and pestle, combine almonds, 1/4 cup basil, and a hefty pinch of salt into a dry, barely hydrated paste. Slowly add EVOO (~3 Tbsp) until a paste consistency is reached. </p>
    <h3>Pasta & Finishing Touches:</h3>
        <p>Bring a pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the orecchiette and cook until al dente (~3 minutes for fresh, ~11 minutes for dry). Drain and transfer to a bowl. Add the pesto, and stir to coat. Mix in the tomatoes and burrata. Plate and serve immediately, garnish with torn basil and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Consume and transcend.</p>
