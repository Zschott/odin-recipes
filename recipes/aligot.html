        <p><em> Aligot is a super cheesy mashed potato recipe that did the media rounds a few years back. Fair warning, this does involve folding in some cheese. How do you do that you may ask? Well, I cannot show you everything, David.</em></p>

    <h2><em>The Story</em></h2>
        <p>This is another recipe I made for my work's social media during the pandemic. At this point, I'd been selected to be a "social media champion", meaning that I had one day during the week where I had the keys to all our social media platforms and was responsible for making some kind of post. I wanted to start experimenting with the Reels feature on instagram, and after the successs of our <a href="./pasta-ricotta.html"> Ricotta Pasta</a> reel, I selected this for my second project.</p>
        <p>This super stretchy & cheesy dish is best served fresh out of the pot for maximum stretch. As it looses heat, the aligot tends to firm up. Enjoy!</p>
        <p><em>Serves 6-8</em></p>
    
    <h2><em>The Recipe</em></h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3> 
        <ul>
            <li>2.5 lbs Yukon gold potatoes</li>
            <li>6 Tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1-2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>¾ lbs <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/products/fior-di-pizza-pizza-cheese"> Fior di Pizza</a></a>, shredded</li>
            <li>3/4 lbs <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/products/smoked-mozzarella">Smoked Mozzarella</a>, shredded</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, and olive oil to taste</li>
            <li>Brenda’s Pepper Jelly for plating</li>
            <li>Protein from <a href="https://thefarmsteadbutcher.com/about-our-farm">Rettland Farm</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
           <li><p>Set butter, cream, and cheeses out to temper for at least 30 minutes to bring up to around room temperature.</p></li> 
           
           <li><p>Skin and cube potatoes. Place in a pot with cold, salted water and bring to a boil. Drain the potatoes when tender (a knife or fork should stab into them with little resistance). Return to pot, and mash (or use a ricer) until smooth and no large chunks remain. Return to stove on a low heat.</p></li>
           
           <li><p>While continuously stirring, mix in butter, and slowly mix in 1 cup heavy cream.</p></li>
           
           <li><p>Fold in <em><strong>half</strong></em> of the cheese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCVKCUB5w50"> (just fold it in, David)</a>. Make sure the potatoes are smooth and homogeneous before adding the rest of the cheese. Add more heavy cream for a smoother texture. Taste for seasoning, adding salt, pepper and/or olive oil.</p></li>
           
           <li><p>Plate with your preferred protein (We recommend something from Retland Farms!) and a smear or hearty spoonful of Brenda’s Pepper Jelly. Enjoy!</p></li>
