        <p><em>Remember that viral feta pasta recipe from TikTok</a> a while back? As it turns out, it can also be made with ricotta.</em></p>

    <h2><em>The Story</em></h2>
        <p>Alright, so I'm seriously cheating on this one. While I've made and written up everything else on this site so far, none of them were full on written up recipes; until now.</p>
       
        <p>This recipe is one that ended up being so good that we did a <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/blogs/recipes/ricotta-pasta">full recipe for on my work's website</a>. So really, I'm copying and pasting a webpage that already exists. Regardless, I was surprised at how well this one came out, and hope you enjoy!</p>
       
        <p><em>Serves 4 - 5</em></p>

    <h2><em>The Recipe</em></h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
                <li>1 medium red onion, roughly chopped</li>
                <li>3 whole cloves of garlic, peeled</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>1 tsp dried oregano</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 basket of Caputo Brothers Creamery <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/collections/cheeses/products/fresh-ricotta-whey-based">Ricotta</a></li>
                <li>2 Tbsp Salumeria Biellese <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/collections/retail/products/salumeria-biellese-nduja">Nduja</a></li>
                <li>1/2 cup basil, loosely packed</li>
                <li>Wine for optional deglazing (or just to drink)</li>
                <li>1 lb. (450g) rigatoni or your choice of pasta</li>
                <li>Your favorite topping cheese (Parmigiano Reggiano, pecorino, <a href="https://caputobrotherscreamery.com/products/vecchio-ricotta-salata">ricotta salata</a>, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><p>Preheat oven to 400Â° F</p></li>
                
                <li><p>Combine tomatoes, red onion, garlic, olive oil, dried oregano, salt, and pepper in a cooking dish. Make a sort of nest in the middle and place the full form of ricotta there. Bake for 45 minutes or until vegetables gain a dark color, and ricotta turns golden brown along the edges. Turn the dish halfway through.</p></li>
                
                <li><p>With 15 minutes left, add the Nduja and return to the oven to finish cooking. Additionally, this is a good spot to get your pasta boiling. Save a half cup of the pasta water!</p></li>

                <li><p>After cooking, remove the vegetable/ricotta pot from the oven. Carefully take out the ricotta and set aside, keeping it in one piece. Also remove the cloves of garlic, mash into a paste, and return to the pot. Add loosely torn basil to the vegetables.</p></li>

                <li><p>(Optional step) Add a splash of table wine (white or red), deglaze the pot, and place in oven for 5 - 10 minutes to remove alcohol.</p></li>

                <li><p></p>Add cooked pasta to the vegetables and mix with pasta water and your preferred topping cheese until nice and saucy.</li></li>

                <li><p>Transfer pasta to a serving dish. Top with ricotta, finely chopped basil, olive oil, freshly ground pepper, and more cheese to your liking. Buon Appetito!</p></li>
